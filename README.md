# ðŸ¤– Agentic AI Assistant â€“ Smart Autonomous Bot

## ðŸ§  Overview

This project is a demonstration of **Agentic AI**, where an AI agent can **autonomously plan, reason, and execute tasks** based on user goals. Inspired by modern architectures like **AutoGPT**, **BabyAGI**, and **LangChain Agents**, this assistant operates with minimal human intervention.

It combines **LLMs**, **task memory**, **tool usage**, and **intent-driven planning** to carry out multi-step actions in response to a user prompt.
